For coursework during the second year of my degree (2016) I got tasked to create a Social Networking Site using no frameworks or libraries.

I decided to base my site around Life Goals where users can upload their goals they want to complete for others to view and comment on.

Created the Front end of the site using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. And the Back end REST API using PHP and MySQL.
