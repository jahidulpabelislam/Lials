For coursework during the second year of my degree (2015/16) I got tasked to create a social networking web application using no frameworks or libraries.

I decided to base my site around Life Goals where users can upload their goals they want to complete for others to view and comment on.

The front-end of the site was developed using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, and the backend REST API using PHP5 and MySQL.

**Capabilities**

*   Sign up, log in & sign out

*   Post, edit & delete a goal

*   Show a goal as complete or not complete

*   Like or unlike a goal

*   Comment, edit & delete a comment on a goal

*   Search for goal/s

*   Make profile private or not private (doesn't do much except change icon & on the database)

*   Upload a profile picture by drag and drop of file/s (only works on Google Chrome)

*   Delete profile picture

*   Follow or unfollow a user

*   View goals of users you are following

*   View profile of users

#### Site not very secure so don't use any sensitive data.
